  Title: Caesar Cipher
  Description: "Communication was dangerous back in the days.\nCan you figure out
    what the original message was?\n\n\nDecipher the characters on the display with
    the help of caesars tactics. The offset is decided by multiple variables. Count
    the batteries, read the serial and check the labels to calculate the offset. Be
    sure to check out our new and updated manual linked below!\n\n[url=https://rawgit.com/LucasMateijsen/ktanemod-ceasarcipher/2702a35/Manual/CeasarCipher.html]Link
    to\r the manual[/url]\n\nFor mission creators: The module type/name is \"Ceasar
    Cipher\".\n\n\r\rWe based our prefab on EmojiMath(Math is hard) which you can
    find [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729096093]here[/url]\n\n------\n\nFuture
    updates might implement a whole new table for when a strike is made. If you have
    any ideas that you would like to see implemented, please let me know in the comments!"
