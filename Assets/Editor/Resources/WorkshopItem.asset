  Title: Ceasar Cipher
  Description: "Communication was dangerous back in the days.\nCan you figure out
    what the original message was?\n\n\nDecipher the characters on the display with
    the help of ceasars tactics. Each battery offsets the characters by one negative.
    There's no delete button so press those buttons carefully!\n\nFor example: if
    there are two batteries, the offset is -2\nSo D becomes B and L becomes J\n\n[url=https://rawgit.com/LucasMateijsen/ktanemod-ceasarcipher/master/Manual/CeasarCipher.html]Link
    to\r the manual[/url]\n\n------\n\nFuture updates will implement the serial number
    and status indicators. Furthermore it might even challenge you to figure out by
    yourself wether you are dealing with a positive or negative offset!"
