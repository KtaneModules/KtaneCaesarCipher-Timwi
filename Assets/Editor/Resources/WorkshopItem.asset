  Title: Ceasar Cipher
  Description: "Communication was dangerous back in the days.\nCan you figure out
    what the original message was?\n\n\nDecipher the characters on the display with
    the help of ceasars tactics. The offset is decided by multiple variables. Count
    the batteries, read the serial and check the labels to calculate the offset. Be
    sure to check out our new and updated manual linked below!\n\n[url=https://rawgit.com/LucasMateijsen/ktanemod-ceasarcipher/2702a35/Manual/CeasarCipher.html]Link
    to\r the manual[/url]\n\n------\n\nFuture updates might implement a whole new
    table for when a strike is made. If you have any ideas that you would like to
    see implemented, please let me know in the comments!"
